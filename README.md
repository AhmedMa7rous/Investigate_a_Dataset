# Udacity Data Analyst Project: Investigate a Dataset (TMDb movie data)

## Overview

<p>In this project, I analyzez a dataset and communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the analysis</p>

<p>This Python script is written for Project 3 (Term 1) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to explore TMDb movie data. But what determines if a movie is considered as good or bad? There could be several factors influencig the quality of a movie, as for example the budget, genre, etc. This little project helped the author to improve his data analytics skills and explore some of the success criteria for movies.</p>

<p>First some Data Wrangling was applied, before the data was cleaned in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.</p>

## What do you need to install?

<b>You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:</b>

<ul>* pandas</ul>
<ul>* NumPy</ul>
<ul>* Matplotlib</ul>
<ul>* csv</ul>

<b> Note: The code was written in <b>Jupyter Notebook</b></b>

<b>I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. Here are the installation steps:</b>

<li>Download the installer from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a>. Choose the Python 3.6 or higher version, and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer.

<li>Refer to the installation instructions <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">here</a>.

<li>Verify the installation, as mentioned <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/">here</a>.
  
## Dataset
  
<p>This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.</p>

<p>Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.</p>

Variables:

<li>id
<li>imdb_id
<li>popularity
<li>budget
<li>revenue
<li>original_title
<li>cast
<li>homepage
<li>director
<li>tagline
<li>keywords
<li>overview
<li>runtime
<li>genres
<li>production_companies
<li>release_date
<li>vote_count
<li>vote_average
<li>release_year
<li>budget_adj
<li>revenue_adj
</br>

## Questions for Analysis

<li>Which genres are most popular from year to year?

<li>What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?

<li>Which movie achieved the highest revenue and the lowest one?

## Conclusions

<li>Movies with higher budgets have shown a corresponding increase in the revenues.
<li>Maximum Number Of Movies Release In year 2014.
<li>'Avatar', 'Star Wars' and 'Titanic' are the most profitable movies and 'The Warrior's Way' is the lowest profitable movie.
